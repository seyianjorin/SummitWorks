Yes, I could see the files now. But I do not see much progress. I see only Model defined there, no Views, no urls, no templates. Please up;load those latest files as well.

- Apologies i made the wrong commit. I have an issue whith my Update. I can only update a product when i specify my path explicitly like "http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/3/updateproduct". when i click on my update button in the product_detail view. it gives me this error " Request Method:	GET
Request URL:	http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/%3Cint:id%3E/updateproduct " how can i go about that. I would also like to ennumerate my product_list view. how can i go about that as well. Oluwaseyi 05/09
